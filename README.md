> The language specification and landing page for my custom language ystar

*This project is part of a collection of projects that comprise the ystar project, read 
more about it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ)*.

## Overview
ystar (stylised y\*) is a procedural, imperative programming language, it has support for both functions
and structs. It is semi-compiled to bytecode which is then interpreted on a virtual machine. 
There is absolutely nothing special about this language or its runtime.

### This specific repo
The compiler and runtime for this project are distinct projects written in different languages
that do not share a common codebase. This collection of documents exists to maintain consistency
between the two.
